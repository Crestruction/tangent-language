# Tangent Language
Tangent Language is an programming language developed by Sakura Gaming for script writing. Its syntax is similar to yaml, but its structure is simpler and easier to understand. It uses indentation as a nested formatter and key-value pairs. Tangent Language cannot be executed alone as a program. It is a top-level language and must be supported by other languages which provides Tangent with a keyword mapping table and script statement execution methods, such as using Lua to execute dynamic script commands and C # to provide core services.

Tangent Language是樱游社专为编写剧本而开发的一种指令式的程序语言，它的语法与yaml类似，但结构更为简单易懂，采用缩进作为嵌套格式符，采用键值对的形式表达指令。Tangent不可以单独作为一段程序执行，它是一种顶层语言，必须由其他语言作为载体，为Tangent提供关键词映射表和脚本语句执行方式，例如使用Lua执行脚本行和C#提供核心服务。
