# Tangent Language
Tangent Language is an programming language developed by Sakura Gaming for script writing. Its syntax is similar to yaml, but its structure is simpler and easier to understand. It uses indentation as a nested formatter and key-value pairs. Tangent Language cannot be executed alone as a program. It is a top-level language and must be supported by other languages which provides Tangent with a keyword mapping table and script statement execution methods, such as using Lua to execute dynamic script commands and C # to provide core services.
